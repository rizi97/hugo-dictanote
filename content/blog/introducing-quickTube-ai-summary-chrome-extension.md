I am excited to unveil our new extension: [QuickTube: Youtube Summary with ChatGPT](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/youtube-summary-with-chat/leidjgpcaiceoeebkdjfcaeboidcjiea).

Quicktube adds a widget to your YouTube interface that shows the video transcript and lets you quickly generate a concise, insightful summary using OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, or Claude. This means you can absorb the key points of videos, podcasts, or even foreign-language content in a few minutes - a true time-saver!
