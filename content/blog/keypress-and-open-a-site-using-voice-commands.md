Voice In v3.23 includes two new custom voice commands:

1. <open:*> to open a webpage. You can use this to open your favorite sites using voice commands. For example, you can create a new voice command 'open youtube' mapped to <open:https://youtube.com>. Then say open youtube anytime to open Youtube in a new tab.
2. <press:*> to simulate key presses on your keyboard. You can use it to press shift+enter to create a line break, or press ctrl+alt+s in Zendesk to mark a ticket as resolved. The voice command is completely customizable.
Here is an example list of voice commands you can implement using this.

Implementing the key press emulation required us to get new permission: debugger. The debugger lets Voice In simulate key press similar to a real user.
Checkout the new voice commands and let us know what you think.

Happy Voice Typing!
