With Voice In v3.49, we have added seven new voice commands to Voice In:

1. **`<deleteword:n>`** Say delete word, delete last two words, up to delete last twenty words to delete the respective number of words.
2. **`<deleteline>`** Say delete line to delete the entire line.
3. **`<backspace:n>`** Emulates backspace. Say backspace one, backspace two, up to backspace twenty.
4. **`<selectall>`** Say select all to select all the text.
5. **`<delete>`** Say delete that to delete the selected text.
6. **`<copy>`** Say copy that to copy the selected text.
7. **`<cut>`** Say cut that to cut the selected text.

These new voice commands greatly improve your ability to edit/delete text hands-free. We aim to continue adding features to bring Voice In to parity with other commercial (albeit expensive) solutions like Dragon Dictation.

Check out the new voice commands on the [Voice Commands page](https://dictanote.co/voicein/voicecommands/en/).

Finally, you can create custom voice commands for the above-listed actions. Refer to the [Custom Voice Commands guide](https://support.dictanote.co/hc/en-us/articles/360040450691-Using-Custom-Voice-Commands-in-Voice-In) to learn how to do this.

Happy Voice Typing!
