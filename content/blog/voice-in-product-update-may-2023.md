Anil here from [Voice In](https://sendy.dictanote.co/l/G9x2wcKDOQ2hHinqZqPKXg/EJGqyKNKJ892M4OreEYxQi763g/ZGwZb17P6GNPPI7lApDiiQ), the #1 speech-to-text extension. We have a number of updates we're excited to share with you. 

### Generative AI
Stop wasting time writing your prompts. Voice In now supports dictation on ChatGPT, Google Bard, Bing Chat, and Poe. Recently, ChatGPT became the #1 most used site for Voice In, overtaking long-time #1/#2 Gmail and Google Docs.

### Six New Voice Commands
We have added six new types of voice commands (shown below). You can now use voice commands to perform actions like changing the dictation language, pressing a keyboard shortcut, opening a webpage, closing the current tab, etc.

You can use these action commands to simplify your workflow. For example, in Gmail, the shortcut to send the email is ctrl + enter (cmd + enter on Mac). You can trigger this action using your voice by adding a voice command "send mail" => (or on Mac).

For more details and example usage, check the [Custom Voice Commands guide](https://sendy.dictanote.co/l/G9x2wcKDOQ2hHinqZqPKXg/qh5nOTZYCDuL1J1VmAuppA/ZGwZb17P6GNPPI7lApDiiQ). 

We have already added default voice commands for some of the commands above. For example, saying "close tab" will close the current tab. See the updated list of default voice commands [here](https://sendy.dictanote.co/l/G9x2wcKDOQ2hHinqZqPKXg/vFKsGdlsUrOb0zvAzKbz6w/ZGwZb17P6GNPPI7lApDiiQ). 

### Other Improvements
1. Sound effect: Voice In now plays a little sound when dictation starts and stops. You can configure whether you want to sound to play on the [options page](https://sendy.dictanote.co/l/G9x2wcKDOQ2hHinqZqPKXg/YOxLgM47Ifb8lg8892pCKwPQ/ZGwZb17P6GNPPI7lApDiiQ) (in the sound effects section). 
2. Improved Japanese language support: Fixed a bug that caused a space to get inserted between sentences and refreshed the voice commands.
3. IFrame support: Now support dictation in iframes. For example, you can dictate in the Google Calendar widget inside Gmail.
Finally, what features should we build next? **If there's a Voice In feature you'd love to see,** there's never been a better time to **[tell me about it](mailto:support@dictanote.co)**.
